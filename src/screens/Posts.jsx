                        On Monday, two hospitals in the city of Bandung announced that they had run out of oxygen, and
                        had to reject new patients seeking emergency treatment.

                        Over the weekend, emergency services and intensive care units of public hospitals in the cities
                        of Bandung, Surakarta, and Pamekasan said they were struggling with an influx of people seeking
                        admission with some having to turn away patients.

                        Others have set up tents outside.

                        "It's a war-like emergency," a woman seeking treatment for her elderly mother told the BBC's
                        Indonesian service. Her mother had first been rejected at a hospital that had run out of beds,
                        and was only able to get admitted to a makeshift tent at another one.{'\n\n'}
